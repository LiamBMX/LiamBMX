# 👋 Hi, I'm Liam! 
An entrepreneur, developer, and AI enthusiast passionate about creating impactful projects. Here's a showcase of my journey and the amazing projects I've worked on:

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🌱 **MindBloom**
> **From NoteNexus to Neurodivergence Support**  
MindBloom is my proudest project, originating as a Chrome extension called NoteNexus for organizing notes and tasks simply and securely. In Summer 2024, I revived it during Prequels Beta Camp, rebranding and focusing on the neurodivergent community. MindBloom is now a platform that helps people with ADHD thrive. It has grown rapidly, and we hope to see continued success!

### 🎥 **RedGen**
> **Faceless Portraits for Passive Income**  
RedGen is an automated system producing faceless portrait-style shorts for TikTok, generating passive income. It offers a subscription-based service for distributing these videos, merging creativity with automation.

### 👻 **SpineShiverProductions**
> **AI-Generated Horror Stories**  
A faceless YouTube channel fully powered by AI. From thumbnails to scripts and voiceovers, everything is automated. I built a script to do it all, making horror content creation effortless.

### 🌐 **Streamer Website Builder**

My first open-source project is a PC interface for building link websites like Linktree—without watermarks and with better designs. It's free and accessible to all creators!

### 🤖 **OmniBot**
> **Advanced Discord Bot for Safety**  
An all-in-one Discord bot with unique features, especially for premium servers. OmniBot scans images using AI to detect and delete harmful or NSFW content before users see it. Although text scanning was costly, the bot remains an innovative safety tool.

### 📰 **ByteTech**

A simple blog site featuring tech news. The highlight is our AI, which scans the web 24/7 for the latest updates, delivering them to our site and users' inboxes faster than traditional sources.

## 🎮 Gaming Projects

### ⛏️ **Minecraft Servers**
> **The Foundation of My Entrepreneurial Journey**  
From 2018 to 2025, I managed numerous Minecraft servers, including DiamondMC, Liam's SMP, ArchevexMC, CellCraft, and GreekMC. These servers taught me how to run a company and honed my coding skills.

## 🛠️ Miscellaneous Projects

### 🖥️ **Smaller Coding Projects**
> **Collaborative Efforts and Freelance Work**  
I've assisted friends with coding for their Minecraft servers, built websites for family businesses, and contributed to many private projects.

From TrendSurge to ToadTunes, I’ve explored e-commerce through dropshipping and private labeling. These ventures continue to excite me, especially during the holiday sales surge!

## 🏀 Recent Ventures

### ⚽ **FanZone**
> **Sports Debates, Simplified**  
FanZone is my latest project, creating a platform to discuss games in real time. It features a game database and chatrooms for users to argue and debate like on Discord, tailored to sports enthusiasts.
