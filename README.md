## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🌱 **MindBloom**
> **From NoteNexus to Neurodivergence Support**  
MindBloom is my proudest project, originating as a Chrome extension called NoteNexus for organizing notes and tasks simply and securely. In Summer 2024, I revived it during Prequels Beta Camp, rebranding and focusing on the neurodivergent community. MindBloom is now a platform that helps people with ADHD thrive. It has grown rapidly, and we hope to see continued success!
